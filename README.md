# Bob the Rebuilder, a plugin for Movable Type

When publishing an Entry in Movable Type, the related templates are also published: the entry, a category archive, monthly archive, and main index, for example. Often in large multiblog installs, however, circumstances arise where some templates aren't republished when needed.

Bob the Rebuilder provides a way to republish a blog (or a part of a blog) on a recurring schedule. For example, create a job to republish an entire blog every 24 hours, or create a job to republish all index archives every 10 minutes. An unlimited number of jobs can be created to republish any blog (or part of it) according to a number of set frequency choices.

Bob the Rebuilder uses the Movable Type Tasks framework, which is typically run by the script [`run-periodic-tasks`](http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/administrator/setting-up-run-periodic-taskspl.html).


# Prerequisites

# Configuration

Bob the Rebuilder is configured at the System level (Settings > Rebuilder in MT5; Manage > Rebuilder in MT4). "Jobs" are used to rebuild a blog or part of a blog on a schedule, and can be enabled or disabled as needed.

"Create a rebuilder job" to get started: specify a blog, what you want to republish, its frequency, and save it. Done!

Its important to be aware of the load you may be placing on the server -- many jobs each republishing an entire blog every few minutes is goint to take a lot of resources. Planning site architecture is outside of the scope of this document, but the goal should be to publish efficiently. Only publish what *needs* to be republished, and republish as little as possible.

Tip: if a blog's archives need to be republished, republish each archive type with a different job using a different schedule. Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly archives almost definitely don't need to be published every few minutes or hours, however a category archive may need much greater frequency.
